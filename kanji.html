		<p><br>Prior to the advent of the Japanese language, there was no formal writing system; meaning that communication was dependent on regional dialects.<br> The Kanji were imported from China in the 7th century, paving the way towards greater literacy and communication within Japanese society.<br>As time progressed Japan began to severe its ties with China; through the introduction of the Kana in replace of Kanji. Although that didn't happen...<br>Fast forward into present day and the Kanji still remains an integeral part of the Japanese language, providing gramatical repreive at the cost of complexity.<br> Each Kanji has two unique readings and pronounciation which can interchange at any moment within a sentence; the <b>Onyomi</b> and <b>Kunyomi</b>.</p>

<h1>What seperates the Onyomi and the Kunyomi?</h1>

<p><b>Onyomi</b> readings tend to have more similarities to their Chinese counterparts and are mostly used as nouns.<br><b>Kunyomi</b> readings are closer in similarity to traditional Japanese pronounciation and are frequently used as adjectives and verbs.</p>
